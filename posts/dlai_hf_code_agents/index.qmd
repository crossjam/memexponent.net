![DeepLearning.AI Certificate - Building Code Agents with Hugging Face

[Completion](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/accomplishments/31a87f63-9159-41db-a498-f9ebb75756da?usp=sharing)
of this short course on DeepLearning.AI isn't a particularly grand
achievement, especially as thereâ€™s no assessment. However, the
material was quite enjoyable for two reasons:

1. It clarified for me the distinction between code generation and
tool calling in agentic systems. ðŸ’¡ To the extent that an LLM can
leverage composition mechanisms, code generation is more flexible and
powerful, at the cost of security challenges. Tool calling feels more
like webhooks or GUI callbacks to me. Definitely useful and maybe even
moreso given clear guardrails.

2. Tickled to see that sandboxing LLM generated code revisits all of
the good efforts from the Systems community over the years. From
programming language work exploring limiting language runtime
capabilities to the long journey of process isolation
a.k.a. containerization. AI may automate away a bunch of coding, but
still lots of design work for humans to do.
