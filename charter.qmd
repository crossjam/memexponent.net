The [_About Memexponent_](about.qmd) expansively covers many of the
drivers behind the work on this site. I’ve distilled a small number of
key technical goals down to a conceptual framework entitled
**PROVEN**. These are highly targeted at AI engineering. Here’s the
concise, technically grounded bullet list expanding PROVEN into its
six pillars:

- **P** | Post-training - Refining and adapting foundation models through
	fine-tuning, alignment, or distillation to specialize behavior for
	the prototype’s goals.
- **R** | Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) - Grounding outputs in
	external knowledge sources—databases, documents, APIs—to ensure
	factuality and contextual relevance. 
- **O** | Observability - Instrumenting AI systems with telemetry,
	tracing, and logging to expose and capture model inputs, outputs,
	and behavior across discrete runs.
- **V** | Velocity - Maintaining rapid iteration of development through
	automation, agentic tooling, and tight feedback loops that keep
	prototype progress measurable and adaptive.
- **E** | Evaluation - Applying quantitative metrics, qualitative review,
	and benchmark comparisons to assess performance, reliability, and
	regressions.
- **N** | Narration - Documenting the prototyping process through public
  artifacts -- build notes, posts, papers, -- to make the engineering
  transparent, reproducible, and open to critique.

Think of PROVEN as the charter of this publication — a mindful,
systematic AI prototyping exploration that joins post-training and RAG
for capability, observability and evaluation for rigor, velocity for
rapid iteration, and narration for transparent, public reflection on
the build process.
